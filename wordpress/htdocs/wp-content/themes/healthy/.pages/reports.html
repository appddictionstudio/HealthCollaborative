        <p>This report is the result of a formal community assessment that reflects over 24 months of collaborative work with agency partners and community stakeholders to establish a shared vision, select relevant indicators, and prepare a document that addresses the important drivers of health in our community.</p>

        <p>In keeping with the national movement in public health to focus more sharply on the root causes of health outcomes, the report devotes significant space to describing social, economic, and environmental conditions. The framework used to organize the report, developed by the Bay Area Regional Health Inequalities Initiative, moves from population characteristics to living conditions, to health behaviors and risk factors, and finally to prevalence of specific diseases and causes of death.</p>

        <p>Following the release of the 2010 Bexar County Community Health Assessment, the Bexar County Community Health Collaborative (The Health Collaborative) partnered with the City of San Antonio Metropolitan Health District (Metro Health) to begin a process to develop a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). A CHIP is a community-wide, collaborative strategic plan that sets Focus Areas for health improvement and engages partners and organizations to develop, support, and implement the plan. A CHIP is intended to serve as a vision for the health of a community and a framework for organizations to use in making that vision a reality. In May of 2012, the first Bexar County Community Health Improvement Plan was published. It was developed with the collaboration, participation and feedback of more than 50 community leaders.</p>
