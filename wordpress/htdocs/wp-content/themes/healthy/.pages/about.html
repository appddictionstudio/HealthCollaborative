        <h3 class="text-underline">Our History</h3>

        <p>The Health Collaborative began informally in 1997 when the city’s major healthcare organizations agreed to put aside their competitive business practices to conduct a comprehensive health needs assessment. The evolution in 2000 to an incorporated entity with a long-range strategic plan is in response to the founding members’ interest in improving the health status of the community by working together.</p>

        <p>The Health Collaborative has developed into a powerful network of citizens, community organizations and businesses. The result is a more robust, less duplicative, more synergistic approach to solving critical community health needs, while efficiently utilizing resources.</p>

        <p><span class="italic bold">Our History</span><br>
        Christus Santa Rosa Health System was founded in 1869 by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word.  The sisters heeded the call from the Catholic bishop of Texas to care the multitude of sick, infirm, and orphaned in the Texas frontier.  When the sisters arrived in San Antonio, the population was only 12,000 and there was no public hospital – until the sisters founded CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Hospital.<br>
        From these humble beginnings, Christus Santa Rosa Health System has grown and flourished just as South-Central Texas has grown.  We remain the only Catholic faith-based, non-profit health care system in San Antonio and New Braunfels.  Our healing ministry now includes three full-service hospitals, one short-stay surgical hospital, the Children’s Hospital of San Antonio and a number of outpatient specialty centers.</p>

        The vision of Christus Health, a Catholic, health ministry, will be a leader, a partner, and an advocate in the creation of innovative health and wellness solutions that improve the lives of individuals and of local and global communities so all may experience God’s healing presence and love.</p>

        <p><span class="bold italic">“Our health care ministry is healthy, prosperous, and enduring.  Our success has been and will continue to be the strength and commitment of teamwork.

        Optimal health for our communities and our environment</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Our Mission</span><br>
        Provide leadership and services for San Antonio and Bexar County to prevent illness and injury, promote healthy behaviors and protect against health hazards.</p>

        <p>The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District is moving in a new direction towards a high-performance health department.  Two key shifts, that have recently taken place, are helping us strive toward this goal.</p>

        <p>One of those initiatives was the integration of clinical preventive services with University Health System.  The move was designed to reduce duplication of services and enhance coordination of care, while simultaneously increasing prevention, early detection, and continuity of care.</p>

        <p>Another key change is the creation of a new service area within Metro Health called Population-based Services.  This division will focus on chronic disease prevention, health education, and wellness while utilizing evidence-based resources.  Examples of some of the division’s major initiatives include tobacco cessation and prevention, prevention of alcohol-related health problems, and a focus on chronic health conditions such as asthma, obesity, and diabetes.</p>

        <p>It is our hope and vision that these key changes, along with our commitment to continuously improve services and programs, and with your partnership, will help us to achieve optimal health for our communities and our environment.</p>

        <p>The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District is the public health agency charged by State law, City code, and County resolution with the responsibility for providing public health programs in San Antonio and unincorporated areas of Bexar County.</p>

        <ul><span class="bold">Public Health</span>
            <li>Prevents epidemics and the spread of disease</li>
            <li>Protects against environmental hazards</li>
            <li>Prevents injuries</li>
            <li>Promotes and encourages healthy behaviors</li>
            <li>Responds to disasters and assists communities in recovery</li>
            <li>Assures the quality and accesibility of health services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Public health is centered around three core functions – assessment, assurance, and policy development – and ten essential public health services.  The Texas Health and Safety Code uses the ten essential services to guide the work of local health agencies.</p>

The ILX Health Strategies Group will build on the company's extensive experience in public health and healthcare marketing campaigns by deepening its resources and expanding its team through the addition of respected health experts.</p>

        <p>“Leading the ILX Health Strategies Group in terms of health-related research and the development of programs and content will be newly hired Interlex Medical Director Thomas Schlenker, M.D., M.P.H. Dr. Schlenker is a seasoned pediatrician as well as former director of the public health departments of San Antonio, Texas, Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City.

Most recently, Interlex and the doctor teamed again to spark and support the development of a campaign to reduce consumption of sugary drinks in order to combat obesity and diabetes.</p>

        <p>Working closely with Interlex, I experienced the power that culturally relevant branding and communications can have on health-related behaviors," says Dr. Schlenker.

"It's wonderful to create life-changing campaigns for our clients," adds Interlex CEO Rudy Ruiz. "To also play a role in identifying and understanding public health problems and developing integrated, comprehensive solutions is a natural evolution for us. We are delighted to have a thought leader in public health at the helm of our new division. And we are eager to grow the scope of our work.

ILX Health Strategies Group's mission aligns closely with the larger company's: to help clients make a positive impact on human lives. While searching for growth opportunities, Interlex will first focus on bringing greater value and expertise to its current roster of health-related clients, which includes: UnitedHealthcare, AARP, Texas Health &amp; Human Services Commission, Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Illinois Public Health Institute, California Public Health Institute, and the City of Houston Health &amp; Human Services.
